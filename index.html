    <h2>4LLL info</h2>

    <p>The following pages contain study tools for the OLL and PLL steps of
        the 4LLL method of solving rubiks cubes. See the
        <a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/4LLL">4LLL page on the Speed Solving wiki</a>
        for more information on what each step is.
    </p>

    <p>Currently these pages are a work in progress. I may not even do anything more than link to
        the Speed Solving wiki pages for some of the steps.</p>
